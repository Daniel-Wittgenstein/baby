    <!--
    
    dirty hack: use auto-built/runtime-built.js for testing
    but auto-builtx/runtime-built.js for deployment on Github pages.

    This will result in an error about not being able to fetch the JS file, but who cares.

    This is needed so that we can still keep "src/auto-built" in out .gitignore
    so that git ignores it, but gh-pages does not ignore it.
